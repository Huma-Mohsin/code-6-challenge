In TypeScript, shrinking an array typically refers to reducing its length or removing elements from it. Here are several ways you can achieve this:

1. Using splice method:
The splice method can be used to remove elements from an array by specifying the starting index and the number of elements to remove.


2. Using slice method:
The slice method can be used to create a new array containing a portion of the original array. This effectively shrinks the array.


3. Using pop method:
The pop method removes the last element from an array, effectively reducing its length.


4. Using length property:
You can directly manipulate the length property of the array to truncate it.


5. Using filter method:
The filter method can be used to create a new array containing only the elements that meet a certain condition, effectively removing unwanted elements.
